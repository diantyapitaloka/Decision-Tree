Classifying the data we have with the Decision Tree technique uses the iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets that is often used for learning machine learning.

Want to predict the species of an iris flower that has a sepal length of 6.2 centimeters, a sepal width of 3.4 centimeters, a petal length of 5.4 centimeters, and a petal width of 2.3 centimeters.
